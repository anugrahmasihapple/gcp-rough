# 1.What is Google Cloud Platform (GCP)?

Google Cloud Platform is a set of Computing, Networking, Storage, Big Data, Machine Learning and Management services provided by Google that runs on the same Cloud infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Photos and YouTube.

Cloud-computing providers offer their services according to different models, of which the three standard models per NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology ) are :

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and
Software as a Service (SaaS)
