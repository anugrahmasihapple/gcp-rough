# 1.What is Google Cloud Platform (GCP)?

Google Cloud Platform is a set of Computing, Networking, Storage, Big Data, Machine Learning and Management services provided by Google that runs on the same Cloud infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Photos and YouTube.
So before looking into the details of Google Cloud Platform, Let’s understand Cloud Computing First.




## 2.What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. It is the use of remote servers on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than a local server or your personal computer.

Cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs to keep their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams, to adjust resources rapidly to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand.

Cloud-computing providers offer their services according to different models, of which the three standard models per NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology ) are :

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
## Platform as a Service (PaaS), and
## Software as a Service (SaaS)

# IAAS 

IaaS (infrastructure as a service) is a computing model that offers resources on demand to businesses and individuals via the cloud. 

IaaS is attractive because acquiring computing resources to run applications or store data the traditional way requires time and capital. Enterprises must purchase equipment through procurement processes that can take months. They must invest in physical spaces: typically specialized rooms with power and cooling. And after deploying the systems, enterprises need IT professionals to manage them.  

All this is challenging to scale when demand spikes or business grows. Enterprises risk running out of capacity, or overbuilding and ending up with infrastructure that suffers from low utilization.

### IaaS defined
 IaaS is the on-demand availability of almost infinitely scalable computing resources as services over the internet. It eliminates the need for enterprises to procure, configure, or manage infrastructure themselves, and they only pay for what they use.

# PAAS
Platform as a Service, also known as PaaS, is a type of cloud computing service model that offers a flexible, scalable cloud platform to develop, deploy, run, and manage apps. PaaS provides everything developers need for application development without the headaches of updating the operating system and development tools or maintaining hardware. Instead, the entire PaaS environment—or platform—is delivered by a third-party service provider via the cloud.  

PaaS helps businesses avoid the hassle and cost of installing hardware or software to develop or host new custom applications. Development teams simply purchase pay-as-you-go access to everything they need to build custom apps, including infrastructure, development tools, operating systems, and more. 

The result is simpler, faster, and secure app development that gives developers the freedom to focus on their application code.

### PaaS defined
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a complete cloud environment that includes everything developers need to build, run, and manage applications—from servers and operating systems to all the networking, storage, middleware, tools, and more.

## SAAS

Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet—as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.

SaaS applications are sometimes called Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider’s servers. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance.

### SaaS defined
A good way to understand the SaaS model is by thinking of a bank, which protects the privacy of each customer while providing service that is reliable and secure—on a massive scale. A bank’s customers all use the same financial systems and technology without worrying about anyone accessing their personal information without authorisation.
