# 1.What is Google Cloud Platform (GCP)?

Google Cloud Platform is a set of Computing, Networking, Storage, Big Data, Machine Learning and Management services provided by Google that runs on the same Cloud infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Photos and YouTube.
So before looking into the details of Google Cloud Platform, Letâ€™s understand Cloud Computing First.




## 2.What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. It is the use of remote servers on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than a local server or your personal computer.

Cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs to keep their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams, to adjust resources rapidly to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand.

Cloud-computing providers offer their services according to different models, of which the three standard models per NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology ) are :

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
## Platform as a Service (PaaS), and
## Software as a Service (SaaS)
